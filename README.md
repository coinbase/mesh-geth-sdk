## Overview

The `rosetta-geth-sdk` repository provides a collection of packages used for interaction with the Rosetta API specification. The goal of this SDK is to help accelerate Rosetta API implementation on go-ethereum based chains. 

[Rosetta](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/welcome.html) is an open-source specification and set of tools that makes integrating with blockchains simpler, faster, and more reliable. The Rosetta API is specified in the [OpenAPI 3.0 format](https://www.openapis.org).

## Quick Examples

### Complete SDK Example

This [ethereum example](examples/ethereum/) provides a reference implementation of the Rosetta API for Ethereum in Golang. This example highlights how to load a configuration, load supported operation types and errors, create a new Ethereum client, and start the Rosetta server.

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/coinbase/rosetta-geth-sdk/examples/ethereum/client"
	"github.com/coinbase/rosetta-geth-sdk/examples/ethereum/config"
	sdkTypes "github.com/coinbase/rosetta-geth-sdk/types"
	"github.com/coinbase/rosetta-geth-sdk/utils"
)

func main() {
	// Load configuration using the ENVs in the environment.
	cfg, err := config.LoadConfiguration()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("%w: unable to load configuration", err)
	}

	// Load all the supported operation types, status
	types := sdkTypes.LoadTypes()
	errors := sdkTypes.Errors

	// Create a new ethereum client by leveraging SDK functionalities
	client, err := client.NewEthereumClient()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("%w: cannot initialize client", err)
	}

	// Bootstrap to start the Rosetta API server
	err = utils.BootStrap(cfg, types, errors, client)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("%w: unable to bootstrap Rosetta server", err)
	}
}
```

The [LoadConfiguration](examples/ethereum/config/config.go) file loads all the Blockchain metadata and Rosetta configuration.

The [NewEthereumClient](examples/ethereum/client/client.go) file creates a new service client, which leverages SDK functionalities, and implements a few gas related interfaces.

### Valid Tokens

See (examples/tokenList.json) for a list of supported ERC20 tokens.

### SDK Packages

* [Client](client): Low-level communication with any `go-ethereum` based blockchain
* [Services](services): Rosetta RESTful services for Data and Construction APIs
* [Utils](utils): Bootstrap code for starting up a Rosetta API server
* [Examples](examples): Examples of how to build your Rosetta integration with the SDK

### Configuring the SDK

See the [Configuration](configuration/configuration.go) file for more information on how to configure the SDK.

### SDK interfaces and method overriding
The SDK defines a list of [Client interfaces](services/construction/types.go), which allows the Rosetta service to interact with a go-ethereum based blockchain.

The SDK provides a default implementation of the client module for a quick start. However, these interfaces require custom integration to override:

## Testing

To validate `rosetta-geth-sdk`, [install `rosetta-cli`](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-cli#install) and run one of the following commands:

* `rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file rosetta-cli-conf/testnet/config.json` - This command validates that the Data API implementation is correct, using the ethereum `testnet` node. It also ensures that the implementation does not miss any balance-changing operations.
* `rosetta-cli check:construction --configuration-file rosetta-cli-conf/testnet/config.json` - This command validates the Construction API implementation. It also verifies transaction construction, signing, and submissions to the `testnet` network.
* `rosetta-cli check:data --configuration-file rosetta-cli-conf/mainnet/config.json` - This command validates that the Data API implementation is correct, using the ethereum `mainnet` node. It also ensures that the implementation does not miss any balance-changing operations.

When you've finished an implementation for a blockchain, share your work in the [ecosystem category of the community site](https://community.rosetta-api.org/c/ecosystem). Platforms looking for implementations for certain blockchains will be monitoring this section of the website for high-quality implementations they can use for integration. Make sure that your implementation meets the [expectations](https://www.rosetta-api.org/docs/node_deployment.html) of any implementation.

You can also find community implementations for a variety of blockchains in the [rosetta-ecosystem](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-ecosystem) repository.
